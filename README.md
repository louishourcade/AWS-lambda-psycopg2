# Deploy AWS Step Functions that supports partial runs

Code to deploy an AWS Lamdba cuntion with psycopg2 library

## Solution overview

## Code deployment

#### Pre-requisites

For this deployment, you will need:
* An AWS account with sufficient permissions to deploy AWS resources packaged in this code.
* aws-cdk: installed globally (npm install -g aws-cdk) 
* git client

#### Clone the repository

Clone the GitHub repository on your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/louishourcade/AWS-lambda-psycopg2.git
cd AWS-lambda-psycopg2
```

#### Configure your deployment

Edit the `app.py` file with information about your AWS account:

```python
aws_acccount = "AWS_ACCOUNT_ID"
region = "AWS_REGION"
```

This is the AWS environment where the resources will be deployed.

#### Bootstrap your AWS account

If not already done, you need to [bootstrap your AWS environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/bootstrapping.html) before deploying this CDK application.

Run the commands below with the AWS credentials of your AWS account:

```bash
cdk bootstrap aws://<tooling-account-id>/<aws-region>
```

#### Deploy the CDK application

Now that your AWS account is bootstrapped, and that you configured your WAF deployment, you can deploy the CDK application with the following command:

```bash
cdk deploy AWSLambdaPyscopg2
```

Confirm the deployment in the terminal, wait until the CloudFormation stack is deployed, and you're done ðŸŽ‰
